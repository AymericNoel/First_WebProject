          <p>First of all, the dollar cost averaging is an investment with the goal of reducing the impact of
            volatility large purchases of financial assets such as equities. </p>
          <p>By dividing the total sum to be invested in the market (e.g. $100,000) into equal amounts put into the market at regular
            intervals (e.g. $1000 over 100 weeks), DCA hopes to reduce the risk of incurring a substantial
            loss resulting from investing the entire "lump sum" just before a fall in the market. </p>
           <p>This subject has been given by Henri LIEUTAUD, our customer who have recovered a large
            amount of data on the trading and he wants us to exploit these data. It’s an ESILV’s project.
            According to the matter, we are 2 teams which work on the same subject but we haven’t the
            same thematic. Our group n°4 works on the fact to create an exchange for the trading where
            the consumers could trade several cryptocurrencies. </p> 
            <p>This platform must be secured, fast and
            easy to trade. Also, we need to do data-visualization for example, on our exchange; the
            consumers could see the amount of cryptocurrencies invested since the opening of their count.
            We have to see correlation or opportunity of buy or sell through the data.
            While the other group need to compute a trading strategy.
