# Simple Web Project
--------


This Website is a simple project in html/CSS to present one of my year's projects : the *Pi carre project*.

I put the code on GitHub because one of my teachers was interested in it.

The site is online on the following link : [The pi carre project](http://picarreproject.surge.sh/).

I enjoyed making this site, reviewing its basics is always interesting.
